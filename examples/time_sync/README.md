# Using the Timesync Service

This example demonstrates how to use the timesync service to establish time sync between your computer and the robot's clock. Specifically, it creates a TimeSyncEndpoint, which can be used to establish timesync as well as determine the clock skew or round trip time.

## Setup Dependencies

This example needs to be run with python3, and have the Spot SDK installed. See the requirements.txt file for a list of dependencies which can be installed with pip using the command:

```
npm install
```

## Running the Example

To run the examples:

```
node time_sync_client.js --username USERNAME --password PASSWORD ROBOT_IP
```
