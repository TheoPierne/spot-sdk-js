# Responding to User Interaction via Light

This example will allow Spot to respond to a light shining in its front
left camera. The following describes what to expect:

- with the robot sitting, shine a light into the front left camera, Spot should stand up
- shine a light into the front left camera again, Spot should start tilting to follow the light
- remove the light, Spot should sit down

NOTE: Both the light detection and controller are very crude. One needs to have a very steady
hand to prevent the robot from "seeing" other bright lights in the front left camera.

## Setup Dependencies

See the requirements.txt file for a list of python dependencies which can be installed with pip
using the command:

```
npm install
```

## Run the Example

To run the example:

```
node spot_light.js --username USERNAME --password PASSWORD ROBOT_IP
```

### E-Stop Endpoint Dependency

The example depends on an external E-Stop endpoint application to configure E-Stop and cut off power to all motors in the robot, if necessary. In parallel with this example, please run the E-Stop SDK example as the E-Stop controller.
