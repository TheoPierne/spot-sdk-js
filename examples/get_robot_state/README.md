# Using the Robot State Service

This example program demonstrates how to query the robot state service for the hardware config, the current robot state, or the robot metrics.

## Setup Dependencies

This example requires the bosdyn API and client to be installed, and must be run using python3. Using pip, these dependencies can be installed using:

```
npm install
```

## Running the Example

To run the example:

```
node get_robot_state.js --username USERNAME --password PASSWORD ROBOT_IP {state, hardware, metrics}
```

As well, the program requires one of `{state, hardware, metrics}` as a command line argument to specify which robot state request to issue when running the example program.
